AIM: 

To write a http web client program to download a web page using TCP sockets in java 
Problem Statement:  
A client program to get the file name from the user.  
A HTTP server program that resolves the given file and displays the contents of the file.  
Concept: HTTP  

1. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol used mainly to access data on the WWW.  
2. HTTP functions as a combination of FTP and SMTP.  
3. SMTP messages are stored and forwarded, but HTTP messages are delivered immediately. 
4. The commands from the client to the server are embedded in a request message. The contents of the 
requested file or other information are embedded in a response message. 
Algorithm:  

Step1: Set a server port as 80. 
Step2: Using HTTP services create a Socket for server by specifying the server port. 
Step3: Use HTTP socket for connecting the client to the URL.  
Step4: Use BufferedReader to output stream to place the response from the server by the client.  
Step5: Close the Connection as soon the request is been serviced. Use Malformed URL exception If any errors in 
grabbing the server 
PROGRAM: 

import java.io.*; 
import java.net.*; 
public class SocketHTTPClient { 
 
public static void main(String[] args) { 
        String hostName = "www.gmail.com"; 
        int portNumber = 80; 
        try { 
            Socket socket = new Socket(hostName, portNumber); 
            PrintWriter out = 
                new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true); 
            BufferedReader in = 
                new BufferedReader( 
                    new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); 
            out.println("GET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.gmail.com\n\n"); 
            String inputLine; 
            while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) { 
                System.out.println(inputLine); 
            } 
        } catch (UnknownHostException e) { 
            System.err.println("Don't know about host " + hostName); 
            System.exit(1); 
        } catch (IOException e) { 
            System.err.println("Couldn't get I/O for the connection to " + hostName); 
            System.exit(1); 
        }  
    } 
} 
 
OUTPUT 
Result: 
Thus the program for creating sockets for HTTP web page upload and download was implemented
